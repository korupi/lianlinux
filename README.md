> An app to control Lian Li Hub lights on Linux

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> I only have **LianLi-UNI FAN-SL-v1.8** hub, so I can't support other devices. Contributions are welcome!

# About
LianLinux is an app written in Rust to control Lian Li hub RGB light on Linux.
Previously it was written in Go, but I do not have many experience with Go, but I am familiar with Rust. Just for my comfort.

# Wiki
For information about installation, usage, supported devices and Lian Li USB protocol [visit the wiki](https://github.com/crptmem/lianlinux/wiki).
